  This script parses out the database logs that fchat spits out, and then turns them into       
  plain text. The script automatically remembers when you last ran it, and will append to       
  existing logs. Note, this only works for the desktop version of f-chat.                       
                                                                                                
  Usage: Update the variables below and then run it. If you want to rerun the full export,      
  delete the lastrun.txt file in your plain text log folder. Note, this script appends to the   
  logs, so it will duplicate unless you delete the folders you intend to rerun.
